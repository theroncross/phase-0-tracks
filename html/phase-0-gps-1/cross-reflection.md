###Theron's GPS 1.1 Reflection###

* Prior Git Struggles
1. origin
2. git staging
3. workflow

* Clarified Concepts
1. Git branching, pushing, and merging on GitHub
2. Correcting merge conflicts
3. Pulling and fetching

* Questions for My Pair and Guide
1. How does git store 'copies'?
2. What's the difference between fetching and pulling?
3. Why merge after pushing to GitHub instead of locally?

* Current Confusion
1. How do you keep from going nuts visualizing all the branches?

* First GPS
1. George and Ryan made it really easy
2. It helped that we both had enough background to solve the problems
3. We were able to just try some stuff and see what happened
4. Navigating is difficult: how much do you watch the driver? How much do you read ahead to prepare?
5. Seems like it would be useful to skim through the whole challenge together first
