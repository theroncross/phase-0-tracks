What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The new elements section a page in a predictabe way that helps with outlining pages for adaptive technologies, among other things.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
Top to bottom, parent to child

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippets are quick to make, and very useful. I would imagine that most of the useful ones already exist, but might need to be tweaked to my liking.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?
I really didn't understand the need for semantic elements until I read the article. It makes sense that a predictable hierarchy would make automation of web content a lot easier. I still need to dig into them a little more to make sure I understand what goes where - w3schools will be my first stop.
