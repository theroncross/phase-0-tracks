# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is an organized way to save progress on a code base. Version control allows multiple people to work on a single project without getting in one another's way. It allows reversions if there are problems with changes. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a separate copy of a file or project. This allows changes to be made without endangering the master copy of the file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 

A commit is an updated save (or version) of a file or project. Commits should be made often, and commit messages should concisely describe the update, addition, or change made (in the present tense).

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two people makes changes to a file or project that can't be merged automatically by git. Instead of overwriting one person's work, git requires one person to pull down the other's changes and merge the copies, often manually.
